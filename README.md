I prefer to call it avoision - because some websites are egregious.

In day to day life we vote with our wallets, but the online world is a different place.  We vote with our clicks.
Avoision: A configurable (Real Soon Nowâ„¢), and free add-on for your browser gives you the power to take back
control... or whatever... be a minor irritation while *feeling* like you have some power.
