### Base URL
*(examples: "nbcnews.com", "yahoo.com/news/")*

### Current Method
*leave blank if it's via archive.today*

### Preferred Archival Method
*outline, via, unvi.is*

### Rationale
*is the current method no longer working?  is it absurdly slow?  why are you requesting the specific method, or why is it
superior to the others?  did you test more than one method, what were the results?*
